  print 'Each player pulls one card from the deck and puts it on the table.' 
  print 'The higher card wins; the player who played it takes both cards and places them on the bottom of his stack. 
  print 'Aces are always higher than Kings in this game, but they are often lower than Jokers (if used).'
  print 'A "war" occurs when the two players play the same rank (two 9s, for example), making a tie.' 
  print 'Each player then deals three cards facedown (the spoils are for the winner) and a face-up card.' 
  print 'The player with the higher face-up card takes all the cards from the war into his stack.'
