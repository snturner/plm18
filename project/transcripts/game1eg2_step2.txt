Rules of Bartok:

There must be at least 2 players and at most 6 players.
Players play turn-based rounds where one player
plays a card from their hand only if that card matches either the
value or the suit of the faced-up card and draws a card from 
the deck if the player has no matches. Then the next player has a turn.
The game is won by the player who has no cards left in their hand.
